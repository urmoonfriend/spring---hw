# My first MVC app

In this project, I learned how to work with ***Spring MVC***

As a model, I have a class of Persons as a model.
I chose ***PostreSQL*** as the database.

The project was assembled in a framework for automating the assembly of projects - ***Maven***.

As a ORM, I used ***Hibernate***.

I ran this project locally on ___Tomcat___ server.

As a views, I used the html pages and the thymeleaf template engine.
All configurations are in the config package.

Access the deployed web application at: http://localhost:8082/people
